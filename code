client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM) )-> we create a object of socket “client_socket”.
AF_INET means it is a Ipv4 address
SOCK_STREAM means that it is a TCP socket.
host_ip = ‘<local address>’-> specifies host ip address.
client_socket.connect((host_ip,port))-> for connecting to the remote socket.
data = b""-> b' or 'B' produces an instance of the bytestype
payload_size = struct.calcsize("Q")
